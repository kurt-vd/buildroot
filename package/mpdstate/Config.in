	  mpdstate is a small C-program which outputs the state of an MPD
	  (Music Player Daemon). The program keeps waiting for changes and
	  outputs immediately the state changes that I found important.

	  The output is easily parsed with shell scripting,
	  and that is how I automate my MPD boxes to:
	  - enable a LED when MPD is playing
	  - activate the power amplifier's power when MPD is playing
