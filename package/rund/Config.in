	  /sbin/init - parent of all processes

	  rund merges the best of 2 init approaches.
	  rund itself is an init daemon that only supervises services.
	  The boot process is offloaded to an external bootscript.
	  This bootscript or any other process can ask rund to
	  run+supervise processes.
	  The configuration of the boot process is reduced to shell script,
	  or any other program of your choice.
	  Yet, complex constructs for service selection
	  remain possible.

	  Spawning services in parallel during boot is easily done
	  with backgrounding parts of the script, a technique that existed
	  for years.

	default y
	help
	  The shutdown script provided by run is able to
	  detect the running init system and act differently
	  according that information.
	  It can halt/poweroff/reboot rund, busybox init, sysvinit, systemd.
