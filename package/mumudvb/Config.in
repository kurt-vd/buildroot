	  MuMuDVB (Multi Multicast DVB) is a program that
	  redistributes streams from DVB or ATSC (Digital Television)
	  on a network (also called IPTV)
	  using multicasting or HTTP unicast.
	  It supports satellite, terrestrial and cable TV, in clear or
	  scrambled channels and run on PC as well as several embedded
	  platforms.
	  It is intended to multicast (the stream is sent
	  once and the network equipments split the data for the
	  different clients) a whole DVB transponder
	  (set of channels sent on the same carrier frequency)
	  by assigning each channel a different multicast group.
	  It detects the different services present as well as their
	  important parameters for streaming, rewrite the main
	  DVB tables to show clients only the right stream
	  in each group. 

	  History : MuMuDVB is originally a modification of dvbstream
	  that http://www.crans.org[cr@ns] made to stream TV
	  in a few hundred rooms.
